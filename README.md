**📌 Medical Diagnosis with Attention Mechanism**
🚀 Leveraging Transformers to Extract and Visualize Key Symptoms from Medical Notes

**📂 Features**
✅ Extracts key symptoms from medical reports
✅ Uses BERT’s attention mechanism for symptom analysis
✅ Generates attention heatmaps for interpretability
✅ Processes structured & unstructured medical text
✅ Custom medical dataset for real-world application

**🛠️ Installation**

cd medical-diagnosis-nlp

# Install required dependencies
pip install transformers datasets torch matplotlib seaborn pandas

**📊 Dataset Structure**
Medical Note	Symptoms
"Patient reports persistent cough, high fever, and difficulty breathing for the past three days."	cough, fever, breathing difficulty
"Mild headache and occasional dizziness, but no fever or cough."	headache, dizziness
"Patient experiences sudden vision loss and severe chest tightness."	vision loss, chest tightness
📌 You can extend the dataset with more complex cases!

🔬 Results & Observations
🟢 Case 1: Persistent cough, fever, difficulty breathing → Strong attention focus on critical symptoms.
🟡 Case 2: Mild headache, dizziness, no fever → Attention shifts to headache & dizziness, lower on "no fever".
🔴 Rare Symptoms: Vision loss, chest tightness → Attention model highlights critical conditions accurately.

**🚀 Future Enhancements**
📌 Fine-tune BERT on a larger medical dataset 📊
📌 Implement Named Entity Recognition (NER) for better symptom classification 🔍
📌 Deploy as a real-time symptom extraction API 🌐
